🔬 I'm a PhD student that enjoys both wetlab (molecular biology, microbiology, microscopy) and drylab (biostatistics, image analysis, data representation) approaches to carry on my work. My current passion and main interest is bio-image analysis, specially from microscopy

👨‍💻 I'm mostly a "software user", using multiple tools to extract as much quantitative information as I can from different types of data from different sources. The main types of data I use are microscopy images and genomic data sequences 🔬🧬. Eventually I hope to move more towards the development end of software research

💻 I try to write straightforward and easy to follow code in Python, Unix, MATLAB and R.

🤓 I enjoy teaaching, speciall helping people with image analysis tasks, from basic concepts (sampling, thresholding, figure construction, reproducibility) to more advanced ones (Deep Neural Networks for segmentation and restoration, pipeline building)

🔎 I'm always on the lookout for new imaging software and tools, as well as being very keen on trying them!
