I'm a PhD student that enjoys both wetlab (molecular biology, microbiology, microscopy) and drylab (biostatistics, image analysis, data representation) approaches to carry on my work.

👨‍💻 I mainly write code or scripts in R, MATLAB and I'm dipping my toes in Python and UNIX computing
🔬 I love microscopy and finding new ways to extract quantitative data from microscopy images
