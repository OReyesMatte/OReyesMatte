I'm a PhD student that enjoys both wetlab (molecular biology, microbiology, microscopy) and drylab (biostatistics, image analysis, data representation) approaches to carry on my work. At the moment I would say I'm 40-60 in this relation.

👨‍💻 I'm mostly a "software user", using multiple tools to extract as much quantitative information as I can from different types of data from different sources. The main types of data I use are microscopy images and genomic data sequences 🧬

💻 I try to write straightforward and easy to follow code in Python, Unix, MATLAB and R.
